            <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
            <p>I believe that every student has the potential to learn and succeed when supported with the right guidance, encouragement, and opportunities. Learning should be hands-on, practical, and connected to real-world contexts, particularly in Technology and Applied Studies, where students can explore problem-solving and design in meaningful ways. At the heart of my practice is a commitment to respect, inclusivity, and equity, ensuring that every learner feels valued and capable. I also believe that collaboration between teachers, students, and families is essential in strengthening learning outcomes and building supportive communities. I view teaching as a reflective and evolving profession, where continuous growth and professional learning are key to becoming an effective and inspiring educator.</p>

            <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
                <div class="visual-quote">
                    <img src="images/teachingquote.png" alt="visual teaching quote - 'Teachers who love teaching, teach children to love learning.' - Unknown" class="img-center" width="300px">
                </div>
            <p>My teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that education should spark curiosity, creativity, and a lifelong love of learning. I strive to create engaging and inclusive classroom environments where students feel confident to take risks, experiment with ideas, and learn through both success and mistakes. Within TAS, I see great value in project-based and practical learning experiences that allow students to connect theory with real-world applications and develop transferable life skills.</p>
            <p>I view my role as a guide and facilitator, supporting students to become independent learners, critical thinkers, and responsible people. Ultimately, I aim to inspire my students not only to achieve academically, but also to develop the confidence and resilience to apply their knowledge and skills in authentic contexts beyond the classroom.</p>
