          <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
          <p>
            I believe that every student has the potential to learn and succeed when supported with the right
            guidance, encouragement, and opportunities. Learning should be hands-on, practical, and connected to
            real-world contexts, particularly in Technology and Applied Studies, where students can explore
            problem-solving and design in meaningful ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the heart of my practice is a commitment to respect, inclusivity, and equity, ensuring that every
            learner feels valued and capable. I also believe that collaboration between teachers, students, and
            families is essential in strengthening learning outcomes and building supportive communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I view teaching as a reflective and evolving profession, where continuous growth and professional
            learning are key to becoming an effective and inspiring educator.

        <!-- Philosophy + quote card -->
        <section class="main">
          <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            My teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that education should spark curiosity, creativity,
            and a lifelong love of learning. I strive to create engaging and inclusive classroom environments where
            students feel confident to take risks, experiment with ideas, and learn through both success and
            mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within TAS, I see great value in project-based and practical learning experiences that allow students
            to connect theory with real-world applications and develop transferable life skills. I view my role as
            a guide and facilitator, supporting students to become independent learners, critical thinkers, and
            responsible people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, I aim to inspire my students not only to achieve academically, but also to develop the
            confidence and resilience to apply their knowledge and skills in authentic contexts beyond the
            classroom.
          </p>
