                    <h3>Matching pyjama set</h3>
                    <p>This textiles project involved producing a screen printed design onto a tshirt. A printed cotton poplin fabric was chosen to sew a pair of pyjama pants. The same fabric was used to make a matching bag that could be used to place the pyjamas in. The set was a mermaid theme with a mermaid scale printed fabric and a mermaid tail was screen printed onto the tshirt.</p>

                    <h3>Banner</h3>
                    <p>This textiles banner utilised various felting and hand stitching techniques. I continued on from the mermaid pyjamas theme and created an under the sea themed banner.3 LED ligts were incorporated throughout the banner (they are not turned on in this image). 1 of the lights is placed in the middle of the sea shell to represent the pearl. The other 2 lights are placed in the mermaid tail to represent the reflection of the sunlight on the scales. </p>

                    <p>This was a food styling and photography task. Various tools were used to prepare the ingredients and create colour contrast. The lighting was set up to enhance the vibrant colours of each ingredient. </p>
